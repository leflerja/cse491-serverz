 * ChangeLog: I started adding the newest logs to the top
 * image.py: Was replaced with sqlite.py
 * galley.html: The formatting and title were fixed, and the indexes were added
 * touching.css: I added the table elements for galley.html
 * Project 4: I imported guess_type from mimetypes and added jpeg and tiff
       images. I made minor changes to sqlite.py and root.py for the needed
       functionality.
 * Project 5: I migrated the thumbnail gallery to imageapp

2014-04-04  Jason Lefler <leflerja@arctic.cse.msu.edu>

 * Project 16: I added a SQLite database to store the images. The database is
       created if the .sqlite file doesn't already exist. After being created,
       it is loaded with the images from /images, and the image_metadata.txt
       file in /imageapp.

 * twill-tests/cookieapp.twill: I added the twill tests from /day23

2014-04-01  Jason Lefler <leflerja@arctic.cse.msu.edu>

 * Project 7: I added the ability to search the image metadata. Just use the
       search link on the sidebar to search the images by name and/or
       description. If an image is selected after being searched for, it is
       moved to the end of the images list (making it the latest image).

 * imageapp/search.html: Added this to search image metadata

2014-03-29  Jason Lefler <leflerja@arctic.cse.msu.edu>

 * imageapp/__init__.py: I changed it to load the dice.png file from the
       images folder where all the images are instead of the imageapp folder
 * Project 6: I added metadata uploading to the imageapp. The name and
       description of the image are stored in a dictionary with the image.

2014-03-25  Jason Lefler <leflerja@arctic.cse.msu.edu>

 * imageapp/root.py: It now exports the CSS background images so they will
       appear on the web site
 * imageapp/html.py: It opens and reads the background images in the CSS and
       returns them to root.py

 * render.py: Removed
 * test_server.py: Updated to send arguments to main()
 * images.html: Fixed the href tag
 * images_thumb.html: Added new page with thumbnail images
 * Project 5: I created an /images_thumb page out of the thumbnails of the
       images from the /images page. It is listed in index.html and is tested
       like all the other pages. The html (images_thumb.html) loops through
       the images, displaying them (reduced to 50 X 50 pixels), 4 per row. Like
       images.html, they are in alphabetic order, and will appear on a new page
       in full size if the image is selected.
